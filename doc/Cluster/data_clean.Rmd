This code is based on code from the ADS Fall 2017 Project 4 Group 8 GitHub respository, and contains modifications.

# Read in data
```{r}
# Original project data
data_train <- read.csv("../data/eachmovie_sample/data_train.csv")
```

# Process
```{r}
movietrain = data_train[,-1]
nrow_movie = length(unique(movietrain[,2]))
ncol_movie = length(unique(movietrain[,1]))
movie.train.matrix = matrix(NA, nrow = nrow_movie, ncol = ncol_movie)
movie.train.matrix = reshape(movietrain, idvar = "User", timevar = "Movie", direction = "wide")
```

# Write matrix
```{r}
write.csv(movie.train.matrix,"~/Downloads/movie_train.csv", na="")
```
